# Abstract


Research on the grammars of heritage speakers of Spanish has become extensive in recent years, but the systematic exploration of how dual-language immersion influences Spanish-speaking childrenâs development of their heritage language is lacking. The present study presents data assessing middle school Spanish-speaking childrenâs knowledge of subjunctive mood and differential object marking by comparing participants in a dual-language school with those in a monolingual school. These two grammatical structures have been identified as challenging to acquire in extensive previous heritage language research with adults. Results from two experimental tasks (one testing production and one testing written receptive knowledge) show that children in the dual-language immersion program have an advantage in their knowledge of differential object marking over monolingually-educated peers, but this advantage does not extend to the subjunctive mood. Implications for teaching Spanish in dual-language immersion programs are discussed.

# Reviewing Dual-Language Immersion

--
- **Dual-language immersion (DLI)** is an equitable way to educate bilingual and bicultural children in U.S. public schools

--
  + English is taught for a portion of the school day

--
  + Spanish or a different language is taught for a different portion of the school day


--
- This is an inclusive method of education because:

--
  + Everyone goes through the process of learning a language
  
--
  + Languages that often have less social power are given equal status (in theory)

--
  + Children who come in with some proficiency in both languages are the "gold standard" (bilingualism as the resoltuion, not the problem)
  

---
# Exposing the Gap


--
There is a large body of research on dual-language immersion that shows benefits of many different sorts:


--
- Faster executive functioning skills (Nicolay & Poncelet, 2013; Garraffa et al., 2020)


--
- Greater sociocultural competence (Bearse & de Jong, 2008)


--
- Higher or equal standardized test scores in mathematics (Marian et al., 2013; Steele et al., 2017)


--
- Greater motivations to stay in school (Christian et al., 2004)


--
- Higher grade point averages (Thomas & Collier, 2002)


--
- Grade-level (or above grade-level) English language arts performance by the end of elementary school (Christian et al., 2004; Marian et al., 2013)

# Revealing the Paradox


--
Heritage Spanish-speaking childrenâ¦also continue developing their Spanish proficiency, particularly more formal registers, an opportunity not offered by the vast majority of United States elementary schools.


(Potowski, 2007b, p. 188)

--

**â¦butâ¦**


--
"What aboutâ¦a study that compares L1 heritage speakers in a dual immersion program with their counterparts in transitional bilingual education programs taught mostly in English?"


(Potowski, 2007a, p. 164).


--
**â¦soâ¦**
--


More needs to be done to adequately document the impact of DLI on heritage language acquisition.


---
# A Role for Education?


--
- Bayram et al. (2017): literacy level affects children's knowledge of Turkish passives


--
- Kupisch & Rothman (2018): French HS educated in French in Germany > Italian HS in Germany


--
- Barnett et al. (2007): Spanish-speaking preschoolers in DLI have higher vocabulary scores than in monolingual programs


--
- To date, no systematic study comparing heritage speakers of Spanish in immersion programs to monolingually-educated HSs *during the school years*


--
- How does language exposure outside of school interact with the role of schooling? (Individual differences)


---
# The Role of Age in Previous Research


- Typically, language development increases with age


--
  + Monolingual children tend to master *most* aspects of their language by the school period
  
--
  + Bilingual children may need longer, but we still hope for an *upward* trajectory


--
- Some studies reveal *negative* age effects in HS children (e.g., Goebel-Mahrle & Shin, 2021; Merino, 1983)


--
- Other studies reveal *positive* age effects (e.g., Corbet & DomÃ­nguez, 2020; Cuza & Miller, 2015; Martinez Nieto & Restrepo, 2022; Montrul & Potowski, 2007)


--
- Many studies reveal no effect for age (e.g., Dracos & Requena, 2022; Guijarro-Fuentes et al., 2017)


--
- Do overall patterns of exposure to the language matter?


--
- Does age interact with education (e.g., education modulates the effect of age)?


---
# Structures Tested


--
- Volitional subjunctive:

--
  + Example: *quiero que VENGAS a la fiesta* (versus *quiero que VIENES a la fiesta*)

--
  + Late-acquired by monolingual Spanish-speaking children (Dracos et al., 2019)

--
  + Variable in child/adult HS (e.g., Dracos & Requena, 2022; Montrul, 2009)


--
- Differential object marking (DOM) or "personal *a*"

--
  + Example: mira Juan (Juan sees) versus mira *a* Juan (she sees Juan)

--
  + Stabilizes in monolingual acquisition by approx. age 3 (RodrÃ­guez-MondoÃ±edo, 2008)
  
--
  + Variable in HS; adults > children (Montrul & SÃ¡nchez-Walker, 2013)

--
  + This structure can impact on meaning in Spanish


---

# Research Questions


--
**1. Do bilingual education and frequency of use of Spanish affect Spanish HS children's development of the subjunctive and differential object marking?**

--
  + Students in DLI will use the subjunctive and DOM more frequently than peers in monolingual schools.

--
  + Children who report using Spanish across contexts more frequently will use more subjunctive and DOM than peers.


--
**2. Do Spanish HS children recognize subjunctive and DOM on a receptive, comprehension-like task more than they produce them?**

--
  + Participants will recognize these structures more on a receptive task than they will produce them, because production is more challenging than comprehension (Perez-Cortes et al., 2019)


--
**3. Do Spanish HS children show improvement in their knowledge of subjunctive and differential object marking as they get older?**

--
  + Adolescent Spanish HSs will produce and select more subjunctive and DOM than younger children.


---
# Participants


--
- 17 Spanish-dominant bilingual adults (SBDA) raised in typically monolingual Spanish-speaking regions (descriptive stats only)


--
- 57 Spanish HS children (all children in two groups by age and school exposure); matched for SES

--
  + DLI-7/8: DLI students in 7th/8th grades (12-14 years old); 50% in Spanish through grade 5

--
  + MLS-7/8: students in a monolingual school in 7th/8th grades (12-14 years old); no Spanish at school

--
 + DLI-5: DLI students in 5th grade (10-11 years old); 50% in Spanish since Kindergarten

--
  + MLS-5: students in a monolingual school in 5th grade (11-12 years old); no Spanish at school

# Methods


--
- BESA proficiency test for bilingual children (PeÃ±a et al., 2014)


--
- Language questionnaire targeting self-reported frequency of use


--
  + 6 contexts of exposure

--
  + 1-5 Likert scales


--
- Productive and receptive domains tested:

--
  + Production: sentence completion task (SCT)

--
  + Receptive knowledge: morphology selection task (MST) between grammatical and non-grammatical options

# DOM: Summary


--
- Age, but not bilingual education or their interaction, is significant at the *p* < .05 level


--
- Possible interaction between age and DLI work together because:

--
  + DLI-7/8 were greater than both monolingually-educated groups, but not different

--
  + DLI-7/8 were not different from DLI-5 (same school, different age)

--
  + DLI-5 were not different from MLS-5 (same age, different school)


--
- Heritage speakers recognized DOM on the MST (receptive task) more than they produced it on the SCT


--
- High degrees of individual variability; nobody *never* used DOM, and some were just like Spanish-dominant speakers

# Subjunctive: Summary


--
- Subjunctive knowledge increases with age, but not as a function of bilingual education


--
- No effect for education is found in the main model nor in the 4-way group comparison


--
- Children select more subjunctive on the MST than they produce it on the SCT


--
- Overall frequency of use matters in speakers' knowledge of this structure


--
- No child *never* uses the subjunctive, and some are within the range of the Spanish-dominant adults


---
# Research Question #1


--
**Do bilingual education and frequency of use of Spanish affect Spanish HS children's development of the subjunctive and differential object marking?**


--
- Prediction: both variables would affect children's knowledge of both structures


--
- Effect of bilingual education with older children in 4-way group analysis only


--
- Overall frequency of use subtly affected individual variability in subjunctive


--
- The hypothesis for RQ1 is partially supported and partially rejected


---
# Research Question #2


--
**Do Spanish HS children recognize subjunctive and DOM on a receptive, comprehension-like task more than they produce them?**


--
- Prediction: HS will use more DOM and subjunctive on a receptive task (MST) than in production (SCT)


--
- Results support this prediction, as well as current theories of HL acquisition (Putnam & SÃ¡nchez, 2013)


--
- Implication: students may understand more than they hear; **input is necessary but insufficient for language acquisition**

--
  + Long argued for second language acquisition (Swain, 1993, 1995)

--
  + Simply providing instruction in Spanish isn't enough!

--
  + We need children to be producing in immersion classroomsâ¦


---
# Research Question #3


--
**Do Spanish HS children show improvement in their knowledge of subjunctive and differential object marking as they get older?**


--
- Prediction: HSs will show growth with age in their command of both DOM and subjunctive


--
- Age modulated rates of DOM and subjunctive production and selection


--
- Age *and* bilingual education may interact in the acquisition of DOM


--
- Hypothesis supported


---
# Implications


--
- Without creating specific efforts to integrate langauge and content, some of the more technical aspects of language might not develop "for free"

--
  + There is often not a systematic focus on language objectives across the content areas in DLI programs

--
  + Harley (1993): some explicit and some content-based instruction is necessary; they should go together

--
  + Babino & Stewart (2017), Potowski (2004): children often (or always) respond in English, even when they receive rich input in Spanish


--
- A space for translanguaging?

--
  + Translingual spaces are important and identity-validating spaces for bilingual children (Ibarra-Johnson et al., 2019)
  
--
  + Guerrero (2023): translanguaging may have negative implications in this instance (shift towards English)

--
  + Does translanguaging have detrimental consequences for the heritage langauge?

---
# Criticality and Dual-Language Immersion?


--
- These findings **do not** devalue the importance of DLI for multiple reasons


--
- Language may not come "for free"

--
  + Greater consideration of language learning objectives for all students

--
  + Sustained and intensive (90/10) DLI *across middle school*


--
- We want to find methods to support heritage language development across the childhood years in an *equitable* and *sustainable* way

--
  + Ibarra-Johnson et al. (2019): language separation with a dedicated translingual space

--
  + Urow & Beeman (2013): TfB and the Bridge; metalinguistic connections between languages and across content


---
# A Self-Critique


--
- Raciolinguistic ideologies (Rosa & Flores, 2017): is it truly important that students speak the way that we would expect them to speak?


--
  + A goal of DLI is to develop competence to interact with *a range of different speakers* (bilingual AND monolingual)

--
  + DOM has important implications for meaning in Spanish, but the subjunctive isn't as essentialâ¦


--
- Registers, metalinguistic awareness, and biliteracy development as important pieces of the puzzle


---
# Bridging the Gap

From Glenn MartÃ­nez (2003, p. 53)


--
**If our students walk into the class saying haiga and walk out saying haya, there has been, in my estimation, no value added. However, if they walk in saying haiga and walk out saying either haya or haiga and having the ability to defend their use of haiga if and when they see fit, then there has been value added. It is critical that we strive to allow students to develop this type of sociolinguistic sophistication in our endeavors as SHL [Spanish as a heritage language] educators.**
