# Introduction


--
- Heritage language theory has developed rapidly in the past decades:


--
  + Incomplete acquisition (Montrul, 2008, 2013)

--
  + Protracted development (e.g., Jia &amp; Paradis, 2020)

--
  + Attrition (Polinsky, 2011; Hicks &amp; Domínguez, 2020)
  
--
  + Reassembly of features (Putnam &amp; Sánchez, 2013)


--
- These theories differ in 4 key dimensions:

--
  + Rate vs. route of acquisition

--
  + Directionality of effects (acquisition vs. loss)

--
  + Level of variability (between-groups, between-speaker, within-speaker)

--
  + Degree of commitment to age effects


---
# Establishing Common Ground


--
- Any study that can adjudicate between these theories in the acquisition of heritage languages by child HSs must:


--
  + Incorporate productive and receptive tasks

--
  + Test a wide age span of children and adults

--
  + Consider differences between the *rate* and *route* of development between HSs and other native speakers

--
  + Consider differences between the *rate* and *route* of development between different HSs


--
- Shifting the questions:

--
  + How can we unearth the conditions that lead to high levels of HL development?
  
--
  + How can we illustrate the remarkable systematicity of heritage grammars?


---
# Education Effects in HL Acquisition


--
- Literacy level and bilingual education affect HL acquisition (Bayram et al., 2017; Kupisch &amp; Rothman, 2018; Torregrossa et al., 2023)


--
- Dual language immersion (DLI): opportunity in the U.S. for children to learn at least 50% of instruction in Spanish (or a different non-English language)


--
  + Input *quantity* is greater for children in DLI programs

--
  + Potentially superior input *quality* in DLI through academic registers


--
- Studying different HL education levels aligns with Putnam and Sánchez's (2013) approach concentrating on individual experiences


--
- Torregrosa et al. (2023): bilingual education impacts structures that also appear to be more challenging to master for monolinguals


---
# Defining Complexity


--
- In generative studies, the notion of complexity has often been defined as the number of syntactic progressions (e.g., Scontras &amp; Laleko, 2021)


--
- In a multi-structure study with bilingual children, Rinke et al. (2023) argue:

--
  + Structures with interfaces with semantics and/or pragmatics are more challenging for HSs to acquire

--
  + Structures that are acquired later may be more complex for HSs to acquire


--
- Can we observe differences between structures within the same speaker?


---
# Differential Object Marking in Spanish


--
- Spanish is one of 300+ languages to mark certain direct objects, particularly those that are [+animate] and [+specific] (Bossong, 1991)

--
  + Other entailments are involved with DOM, but only these two "core" considerations are discussed here

--
  + DOM-marked objects are preceded by the marker *a* (morphological realization of DOM)


--
- In Spanish, [+animate] and [+specific] direct objects raise from VP-internal to check an interpretable D-feature in _spec,vP_ (Torrego, 1998)


--
- Challenges in mastering/maintaining DOM for English-Spanish bilinguals:

--
  + DOM is not present in English, making it subject to crosslinguistic influence

--
  + There is an interface between syntax and semantics, which may make this structure more challenging to master (e.g., Sorace, 2011)


--
- DOM is an interface structure (syntax/semantics) but it is acquired early, by age 3 (Rodríguez-Mondoñedo, 2008)

---
# Volitional Subjunctive in Spanish


--
- There is no *single* representation for this structure (Fábregas, 2014), but:

--
  + One set of morphological inflections

--
  + There are multiple degrees of interfaces involved with different uses of the subjunctive


--
- The volitional subjunctive is selected by a matrix verb or phrase (Kempchinsky, 2009):

--
  + Matrix items select an uninterpretable mood feature
  
--
  + Feature checking in the heads of Force and Fin in the subordinate clause


--
- The subjunctive is heavily studied with Spanish HSs, with the following consensus:

--
  + Proficiency and exposure affect rates of subjunctive production (Dracos &amp; Requena, 2022; Giancaspro, 2019; Montrul, 2009; Perez-Cortes, 2016)

--
  + Receptive knowledge is easier to access than production (Perez-Cortes, 2016)

--
  + Lexical frequency and morphological regularity influence variability (Giancaspro, 2020; Giancaspro et al., 2022)


--
- The volitional subjunctive represents core syntax, but is acquired late by monolinguals (Blake, 1983; Dracos et al., 2019)


---
# Research Questions


--
**1. Do HSs show similarities with Spanish-dominant bilinguals at the group and individual levels?**

Prediction: HSs will differ as a group, but some will converge on norms of Spanish-dominant adults.


--
**2. Does interface variability or timing of acquisition account for more variability in HL acquisition?**

Prediction: later-acquired structures will be more challenging to acquire than interface structures.


--
**3. Does bilingual education affect command of DOM with [+animate] and [+specific] direct objects and of the volitional subjunctive?**


Prediction: Dual language education will positively impact production/selection of DOM and volitional subjunctive.


--
**4. Do children continue to master inflectional morphology with age into adulthood?**


Prediction: children will show increased development across adolescence and into adulthood.


--
**5. Do HSs show stronger receptive than productive knowledge of mood?**


Prediction: participants will have stronger receptive than productive command of these structures.


---
# Participants


--
- 127 total participants (Spanish HSs dominant in English)

--
  + 41 5th grade Spanish HS, ages 10-11 (HS5)

--
  + 34 7th/8th grade Spanish HS, ages 12-14 (HS7/8)

--
  + 35 HS adults (HSA)

--
  + 18 Spanish-dominant bilingual adults (SDBA)


--
- HS5 and HS7/8 were further evaluated for educational experience:

--
  + DLI students (received 50% of elementary education in Spanish + Spanish HL course in middle school)
  
--
  + Other students received a traditional monolingual English education

--
  + Both schools were selected because of their similar student bodies (socioeconomic status, home Spanish speakers, number of English language learners)


--
- Extensive diversity in Spanish dialects:

--
  + Participants or their relatives were from 13 total Spanish-speaking countries
  
--
  + No documented optionality in DOM use in [+animate] and [+specific] contexts with definite and proper nouns


---
# Methods


--
- BESA proficiency measure of morphosyntactic competence (Peña et al., 2014)


--
- Language questionnaire targeting self-reported frequency of use


--
  + 6 contexts of exposure

--
  + 1-5 Likert scales


--
- Productive and receptive domains tested:

--
  + Production: sentence completion task (SCT)

--
  + Receptive knowledge: morphology selection task (MST) between grammatical and non-grammatical options


--
- Tasks tapped subjunctive and DOM in the following contexts:

--
  + DOM: after -ar verbs with 3rd person plural subjects and preceding a proper noun

--
  + Subjunctive: in the subordinate clause following the verb *querer*

# Individual Performance with DOM





&lt;img src="index_files/figure-html/print-DOM-diffs-plot-1.png" width="1152" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Research Question #1


--
- All groups of HSs do differ in their *rates* of subjunctive production and selection of both structures at the group level


--
- Many individual HSs, including at least one from each age group, converged on the levels of the Spanish-dominant adults


--
- Not a single participant categorically omitted DOM nor the subjunctive (present in their grammars: every participant used the subjunctive and DOM in at least two sentences)


---
# Research Question #2

**Does interface variability or timing of acquisition account for more variability in HL acquisition?**

--
- Prediction: later-acquired structures will be more challenging to acquire than interface structures

--
- DOM production/selection &gt; subjunctive; timing of acquisition may affect development more than interface effects


--
- Far more structures are needed, but forthcoming work with HSs of Spanish shows similar results when also integrating more structures


--
- Prediction #2 supported


---
# Research Question #3


--
**Does bilingual education affect command of DOM with [+animate] and [+specific] direct objects and of the volitional subjunctive?**


--
- Prediction: Dual language education will positively impact production/selection of DOM and volitional subjunctive


--
- Bilingual education affected the earlier-acquired structure more, unlike in Torregrossa et al. (2023)

--
  + DL reinforces what HSs have already picked up in their linguistic environment

--
  + This method of education may not be enough to fully support the development of structures that are mastered by monolinguals around the school period


--
- The prediction is partially supported (for DOM only)


--
- The advantage for DOM emerged most in the older children without 50% of their school exposure to Spanish


--
  + Language continues to develop past the immersion years in HSs

--
  + Does this suggest that cumulative exposure matters more than current exposure?


--
- Dual language immersion does not *guarantee* sustained acquisition of all structures


---
# Research Question #4


--
**Do children continue to master inflectional morphology with age into adulthood?**


--
- Prediction: children will show increased development across adolescence and into adulthood


--
- The younger the participant, the less likely to use the two structures


--
- Similar developmental paths were identified for participants in the acquisition of DOM and subjunctive:


--
  + Increase from 5th grade to 7th/8th grade (ages 11 to 14)

--
  + The HS7/8 and HSA are quite similar to one another in their production and selection tendencies
  
--
  + Bilingual children are largely adult-like by early adolescence (with different rates of subjunctive production)


---
# Research Question #5


**Do HSs show stronger receptive than productive knowledge of mood?**


--
- Prediction: participants will have stronger receptive than productive command of these structures


--
- Bilinguals exhibited stronger command of both structures on receptive tasks


--
- Supports Putnam and Sánchez (2013), who argue that receptive knowledge is easier to acces; however:


--
  + Participants' asymmetries across tasks do not appear to increase with age

--
  + Therefore, there is no evidence of even partial restructuring of Spanish


---
# Conclusion


--
- Bilingual education does not appear to affect all structures equally


--
- Stronger receptive than productive knowledge; preference for production/selection of DOM


--
- HSs of Spanish continue to acquire inflectional morphology into adolescence (supports protracted development, e.g., Jia &amp; Paradis, 2020)


--
- Later-acquired structures are challenging, even if they are interface-free


--
- HSs' overall knowledge appears to be different when compared to adult populations of native speakers


--
- Some HSs converge on the tendencies of Spanish-dominant bilinguals; none completely omit either structure


--
- Not a single theory can capture these results:

--
  + HSs' knowledge increases over time (route of acquisition): protracted development (Jia &amp; Paradis, 2020)


--
  + HSs' grammatical systems differed from those of Spanish-dominant bilingual adults, who were categorical

--
  + HSs do not appear to be restructuring knowledge, but Putnam and Sánchez (2013) correctly predict asymmetries between production and receptive knowledge
