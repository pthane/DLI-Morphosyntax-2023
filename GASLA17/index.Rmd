# Introduction


--
- There has been extensive theorizing concerning HL acquisition and maintenance within generative paradigms:


--
  + Incomplete acquisition (e.g., Montrul, 2008, 2013)

--
  + Protracted development (e.g., Corbet & Domínguez, 2020; Cuza & Miller, 2015; Jia & Paradis, 2020)
  
--
  + Attrition/reassembly of features (e.g., Hicks & Domínguez, 2020; Putnam and Sánchez, 2013)


--
- School-aged heritage speakers are the "missing link" in heritage language acquisition (Montrul, 2018, p. 534)

--
  + Extensive research in bilingual first language acquisition with young children

--
  + Heavy focus on HL acquisition and maintenance in adulthood

--
  + What is the developmental trajectory between these age ranges?

--
  + Do we observe HL growth or loss during these years?


---
# Theories of HL Acquisition/Maintenance


--
- Incomplete acquisition (e.g., Montrul, 2008, 2013): HS differ from other populations due to:

--
  + Decreased/divided input after the onset of schooling

--
  + Early onset of acquisition of an additional language

--
  + Different *route* of acquisition

--
  + Focus on between-group differences (and some differences between speakers)


--
- Protracted development (e.g., Corbet & Domínguez, 2020; Cuza & Miller, 2015; Jia & Paradis, 2020)

--
  + Slower acquisition of morphosyntactic structures by bilingual children

--
  + Different *rate* of acquisition

--
  + Focus on between-group differences between bilingual and monolingual children


--
- Reassembly of HL grammars (Putnam & Sánchez, 2013)

--
  + HSs reassemble featural bundles over time due to crosslinguistic influence ("reverse" of Feature Reassembly Hypothesis, Lardiere, 2008, 2009)

--
  + The degree/speed of this restructuring is driven by HL activation/exposure and individual HL experiences (between-speaker differences)

--
  + Production is more impacted than receptive knowledge (within-speaker differences)


---
# The Dimensions of HL Acquisition Theory


--
- These theories differ in three key dimensions:

--
  + Rate vs. route of acquisition

--
  + Directionality of predictions (development vs. loss)

--
  + Level of variability (between-group, between-speaker, within-speaker)


--
- Can we achieve a theory that focuses on rate/route of development at all of these levels (between-groups, between-speakers, within-speakers) and that can be bidirectional (e.g., acquisition and attrition) in child HL acquisition?


---
# Education Effects in HL Acquisition


--
- Literacy level and bilingual education affect HL acquisition (Bayram et al., 2017; Kupisch & Rothman, 2018; Torregrossa et al., 2023)


--
- Dual language immersion (DLI): opportunity in the U.S. for children to learn at least 50% of instruction in Spanish (or a different non-English language)


--
  + Input *quantity* is greater for children in DLI programs

--
  + Potentially superior input *quality* in DLI through academic registers


--
- Studying different HL education levels aligns with Putnam and Sánchez's (2013) approach concentrating on individual experiences


---
# Differential Object Marking in Spanish


--
- Spanish is one of 300+ languages to mark certain direct objects, particularly those that are [+animate] and [+specific] (Bossong, 1991)

--
  + Other entailments are involved with DOM, but only these two "core" considerations are discussed here

--
  + DOM-marked objects are preceded by the marker *a* (morphological realization of DOM)


--
- In Spanish, [+animate] and [+specific] direct objects raise from VP-internal to check an interpretable D-feature in _spec,vP_


--
  + Example of inherent case marking

--
  + The *a* marking is also present with all indirect objects to mark dative case regardless of semantics


---
# Why DOM?


--
- English does not have DOM (or any object marking), making it an area to study crosslinguistic influence

--
- DOM is abundantly studied in HL acquisition; its development is affected by:

--
  + Patterns of HL exposure (Montrul & Sánchez-Walker, 2013)

--
  + Morphosyntactic proficiency (Arechabaleta-Regulez & Montrul, 2023; Guijarro-Fuentes et al., 2017; Montrul & Bowles, 2009)


--
- The role of age in DOM acquisition remains unclear:

--
  + HS adults produce more DOM than children (Montrul & Sánchez-Walker, 2013)

--
  + No age effects within children (Cuza et al., 2019) or adolescents (Guijarro-Fuentes et al., 2017)


--
- To date, there is not yet a single study on DOM that:

--
  + Has both productive and receptive tasks

--
  + Tests the role of proficiency and frequency of exposure

--
  + Traces development from early adolescence to adulthood


---
# Research Questions


--
** 1. At the group and individual levels, do English-dominant HSs converge on the Spanish-dominant DOM system with animate and specific direct objects?**


--
** 2. Do HSs develop stronger knowledge of DOM with animate and specific direct objects with age? **


--
** 3. Do proficiency, frequency of HL exposure, and bilingual education influence HSs' command of DOM with animate and specific direct objects? **


--
** 4. Do HSs show stronger receptive knowledge of DOM than they produce this structure?**


---
# Participants


--
- 127 total participants

--
  + 41 5th grade Spanish HS, ages 10-11 (HS5)

--
  + 34 7th/8th grade Spanish HS, ages 12-14 (HS7/8)

--
  + 35 HS adults (HSA)

--
  + 18 Spanish-dominant bilingual adults (SDBA)


--
- HS5 and HS7/8 were further subdivided into different groups:

--
  + DLI students (received 50% of elementary education in Spanish + Spanish HL course in middle school)
  
--
  + Other students received a traditional monolingual English education

--
  + Both schools were selected because of their similar student bodies (socioeconomic status, home Spanish speakers, number of English language learners)


--
- Extensive diversity in Spanish dialects:

--
  + Participants or their relatives were from 13 total Spanish-speaking countries
  
--
  + No documented optionality in DOM use in [+animate] and [+specific] contexts with definite and proper nouns


---
# Background Tasks

--
- Bilingual English-Spanish Assessment (BESA; Peña et al., 2018)

--
  + 18 questions evaluating multiple morphosyntactic structures

--
  + Number of expected answers used as proficiency score in statistical modeling


--
- Language questionnaire evaluating linguistic variables (children self-completed tasks per Castilla-Earls et al., 2022):

--
  + Spanish dialects spoken at home
  
--
  + Languages spoken at home

--
  + Frequency of use (1-5 Likert scale) across 6 contexts (continuous variable for statistics)


---
# Linguistic Tasks


--
- Two tasks targeting DOM use:

--
  + With [+animate] and [+specific] direct objects

--
  + 3rd person plural verb (ending in -an) to increase salience of *a*

--
  + DOM was only included preceding the proper noun _Juanito_ where no dialectal variability of DOM is attested


--
- **Elicited production task (EPT)**: participants completed 10 sentences targeting DOM orally


--
- **Morphology selection task (MST)**: written multiple choice between 8 sentences with and without DOM

# Research Question #1


--
- **At the group and individual levels, do English-dominant HSs converge on the Spanish-dominant DOM system with animate and specific direct objects?**


--
- SDBAs do not show variability in producing/selecting DOM with animate and specific direct objects


--
- HSs show more heterogeneity / variability in DOM production and selection than SDBAs


--
- HSs *can* perform within the range of SDBAs (19/109 HSs were within SDBA range)


--
- Not a single HS does not use DOM in either production/selection in at least two instances


---
# Research Question #2


--
- **Do HSs develop stronger knowledge of DOM with animate and specific direct objects with age? **


--
- Gradual increases across age groups in descriptive and inferential statistics


--
- HSs continue to acquire DOM at a different rate from monolinguals between adolescence and adulthood


--
- Joins a growing body of work showing continuation of HL acquisition late into childhood and even into adulthood in multiple languages:

--
  + Greek (Daskalaki et al., 2022)

--
  + Mandarin (Jia & Paradis, 2020)

--
  + Portuguese (Flores & Barbosa, 2014; Flores et al., 2017)
  
--
  + Spanish (e.g., Corbet & Domínguez, 2020; Cuza & Miller, 2015; Montrul & Sánchez-Walker, 2013)


---
# Research Question #3


--
- **Do proficiency, frequency of HL exposure, and bilingual education influence HSs' command of DOM with animate and specific direct objects?**


--
- Proficiency affected HSs' production/selection of DOM, but not frequency of use


--
- Bilingual education affects children's production and selection of DOM


--
- Critical finding from both a linguistic and social justice perspective


---
# Research Question #4


--
- **Do HSs show stronger receptive knowledge of DOM than they produce this structure?**


--
- HSs' performance on the MST was stronger than on the EPT; all HSs showed *some* use of DOM


--
- Supports research arguing for a dissociation between morphology and syntax in HL acquisition


---
# Theoretical Discussion


--
- Tenets of each theory applies at different levels:

--
  + Incomplete acquisition: differences between HSs and other groups of native speakers (between-groups; route)

--
  + Protracted development: continued development with age into adulthood (between-groups; rate)

--
  + Putnam & Sánchez (2013): language experience modulates differences between individual HSs; separation of syntax and morphology (between-speaker and within-speaker)


--
- Incomplete acquisition partially explains group-level difference:


--
  + Some HS converged on rates of Spanish-dominant bilingual adults

--
  + None of the HS categorically omitted DOM across tasks


--
- Putnam and Sánchez's (2013) account partially supports results:

--
  + Accounts for variability at the between-speaker and within-speaker levels

--
  + No evidence of _re_ assembly of features, but rather protracted development

--
  + Is it possible that Putnam and Sánchez's (2013) approach runs in reverse in initial but protracted process?

--
  + Proficiency and education (individual experiences and proxies for exposure?) modulate the rate and ultimate route of development


---
# Limitations


--
- Only evaluated DOM in "core" contexts such as [+animate] and [+specific] direct objects


--
- Broader age range to make a clearer set of predictions regarding protracted development: how would younger bilinguals perform?


--
- Did not control for age of acquisition using statistical modeling (only requested number of bilingual parents)
