# Introduction


- Background:


--
  + Graduated from Rutgers (Bilingualism/SLA) in 2023
  
--
  + Dissertation on heritage language (HL) acquisition in dual language schools
  
--
  + Current postdoctoral fellow in Dual Lab, University of Houston

--
  + Incoming asst. professor at UT Austin


--
- My research areas

--
  + Morphosyntactic development in bilingual Spanish

--
  + Language acquisition in dual language schools

--
  + Typical and atypical morphological development


--
- Research aims:


--
  + Bring together theoretical and applied research in language acquisition

--
  + Create a holistic perspective of heritage language development, particularly in children

--
  + Challenge deficit notions of bilingualism through novel perspectives on the language faculty

---
# Summing Up

Link to article: https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bilingualism-language-and-cognition/article/acquiring-morphology-through-adolescence-in-spanish-as-a-heritage-language-the-case-of-subjunctive-mood/674D0A3F8DAAAE5388E728FD98C07D15


--
* Theories within generative heritage language (HL) acquisition differ in multiple dimensions (see Table 3)

--
  + Language acquisition vs. language loss
  
--
  + Focus on group-level or individual-level differences
  
--
  + Process vs. product of acquisition (end result or continuing shifts?)

--
* Understanding bilingual development in childhood might help us to achieve a "unified" acquisition theory


--
* Most existing theories are needed in order to account for results at three levels:

--
  + Group-level differences (why do HSs differ from other types of bilinguals?)

--
  + Individual-level differences (why do some HSs differ from others?)

--
  + Within-speaker differences (what factors characterize the "gray area" in why HSs show very gradient knowledge?)


---
# Unpacking Putnam and SÃ¡nchez (2013)


- You've already read about incomplete acquisition (see work by S. Montrul), which proposes:

--
  + Language development is interrupted due to a reduction in input

--
  + HSs differ as a group from other groups of speakers as a result


--
- Putnam and SÃ¡nchez discuss *feature reassembly:*

--
  + In generative linguistics, language is made up of bunches of features

--
  + These features get *reassembled* if exposure to the HL is low (prediction of language loss)

--
  + Producing the HL is harder than interpreting it (explains scenario of balanced bilinguals)

--
  + Language acquisition as a process; explains differences between/within speakers
  

--
- These theories do NOT make conflicting predictions, BUTâ€¦

--
  + â€¦Putnam & SÃ¡nchez (2013) is proposed as an alternative to incomplete acquisition

--
  + â€¦They do differ on philosophical grounds (should we study group-level differences at all?)


---
# Shifting Our Methods


--
- The way we craft our studies can be limiting in the contributions we make!


--
- To test individual differences, we need detailed and precise questionnaire data to gather information about:

--
  + Patterns of exposure and use

--
  + Age of acquisition


--
- In order to evaluate within-speaker differences, we need to:

--
  + Study both production and receptive knowledge (separate tasks)

--
  + Conduct longitudinal studies, whenever possible
  
--
  + Test multiple linguistic structures or areas


--
- We almost always design studies whose questions focus on only 1-2 of three levels mentioned previously:


--
  + Group-level

--
  + Individual-level

--
  + Within-speaker


---
# Results


- Spanish-dominant bilingual adults produce and select subjunctive more than all *groups* of heritage speakers


--
- Individual differences paint a different picture:

--
  + 25/109 HSs produced subjunctive within the range of Spanish-dominant adults

--
  + All participants used (produced + selected) subjunctive in at least 2 instances

--
  + HSs are either gradient or categorical in using the subjunctive (but never in omitting it), so group-level differences are quite misleading


--
- Proficiency and use of Spanish modulated individual subjunctive production and selection rates


--
- Older children and adults use similar rates of subjunctive, more than the fifth grade children


--
- Greater selection of subjunctive than production (in line with Putnam and SÃ¡nchez, 2013)


--
- Sets the stage for creating a comprehensive theory of HL acquisition by children:


--
  + Nuances at the between-groups, individual, and within-speaker levels

--
  + (Indirectly) evaluates continued development across the childhood years

--
  + Along with partner studies, requires bridging theoretical linguistics with the education

--
  + Achieves a new perspective that HSs' grammars are *more* complex than those of monolinguals


---
# Pausing, Reflecting, and Transitioning


--
- Any questions, theoretical or otherwise?


--
- What are the implications of this work for our view of heritage bilingualism?


--
- How can we make these data transparent and reproducible to contribute to open science?


--
- How do we make critical decisions in R that influence our analyses?


---
# Reproducible Research in R Using GitHub


--
- Anonymized data without identifiers (name, DOB, any sort of ID number, etc.) are not human subjects data and can be shared publicly


--
- The data and code from this study (and all studies from my dissertation) are available on GitHub, and links to the repository are in my manuscripts (https://github.com/pthane/DLI-Morphosyntax-2023)


--
- GitHub is a place to store codes and other documents related to your research such as:


--
  + *ANONYMIZED* CSV files

--
  + Scripts used for coding
  
--
  + Text files explaining the structure of your repository (usually RTF files)

--
  + Presentations and HTML documents prepared in RMarkdown


--
- This allows others to download and elaborate on your work for free


--
  + GitHub membership is free and unlimited with an @.edu email address
  
--
  + Public repositories are visible to the entire Internet
  
--
  + R is free, and RTF files do not require Microsoft Word (accessible to all)


--
- This satisfies open materials requirements for publications along with a list of stimuli or interview questions


---
# Reproducible Coding in R


--
- Using the `here` function helps others who download your work to reproduce it

--
  + Use this when loading or creating CSV or Excel files

--
  + This creates a _relative path_ so that anyone who downloads your code can use it

--

```{r, here-example, echo = TRUE}
## Install `here` package
install.packages("here", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org/")


## Load `here` package on every script
library(here)


## Load a CSV file with `here`
## (Notice the use of parentheses. The name of the file begins in the same place where the .Rproj
## file is stored. We will use the adult HSs' production data as an example.)
My_Data <- read_csv(here("CSV Files", "Adult HS", "Adult HS Subjunctive EPT.csv"))
```

# Presentations in R with `xaringan`


- The `xaringan` package allows you to turn an RMarkdown file into slides that contain code

--
  + This and all presentations in my GitHub repository were created using `xaringan`

--
  + `xaringan` allows you to use any code as you would in regular R scripts to create presentations


--
- Using `xaringan` has a number of advantages:

--
  + Great for conference presentations that you want others to be able to see after via GitHub

--
  + Great for projects with ongoing data collection

--
  + Perfect for showing a reproducible product to general audiences

--
  + You can post code in your slides, allowing others to learn


--
- Tutorial for using `xaringan`: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPFh3y9UAX4

--
  + Includes 2 hours of instruction and practice activities

--
  + You don't need all 2 hours to get started and get familiar


---
# Sharing `xaringan` RSlides Using GitHub


- All data can be downloaded and presentations can be shared using stable URLs


--
- You must create a subfolder in your RProject with an RMarkdown file named index.Rmd in it, where you will put all of your code to create your slides


--
- After you knit your RMarkdown file with all of the desired code for the presentation, you can upload it to GitHub.


--
- Every GitHub repository has settings to make it into a GitHub site:

--
  + Settings > Pages (on left menu)

--
  + In _Pages_, select 'main' under 'Branches' (this is only possible after you have uploaded files)
  
--
  + Remember to save your settings!


--
- When uploaded to a GitHub repository, the resulting index.html file will automatically turn into a public version of your slides after a few minutes


--

# Tying It All Together


- The BLC paper was prepared using *fully* open science:


--
  + Published open access in BLC (free for you while at OSU: https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/open-access-policies/read-and-publish-agreements/oa-agreement-ohiolink)
  
--
  + All anonymized data are on GitHub and visible to anyone

--
  + `here` and `xaringan` make it easy to share these results with others


--
- Theoretical contributions to language acquisition theory *should* be reproducible because:

--
  + Language is a human right (and bilingualism therefore is too)

--
  + Our ability to make claims about the way that language works depends on the analyses we perform
  
--
  + Sometimes, others may have different ideas on how to make analyses more robust, and sharing our approach is a necessary first step
