--
  + Typical and atypical morphological development


--

--
  + Challenge deficit notions of bilingualism through novel perspectives on the language faculty

---
# Summing Up

Link to article: https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bilingualism-language-and-cognition/article/acquiring-morphology-through-adolescence-in-spanish-as-a-heritage-language-the-case-of-subjunctive-mood/674D0A3F8DAAAE5388E728FD98C07D15


--
* Theories within generative heritage language (HL) acquisition differ in multiple dimensions (see Table 3)

--
  + Language acquisition vs. language loss
  
--
  + Focus on group-level or individual-level differences
  
--
  + Process vs. product of acquisition (end result or continuing shifts?)

--
* Understanding bilingual development in childhood might help us to achieve a "unified" acquisition theory


--
* Most existing theories are needed in order to account for results at three levels:

--
  + Group-level differences (why do HSs differ from other types of bilinguals?)

--
  + Individual-level differences (why do some HSs differ from others?)

--
  + Within-speaker differences (what factors characterize the "gray area" in why HSs show very gradient knowledge?)


---
# Unpacking Putnam and Sánchez (2013)


- You've already read about incomplete acquisition (see work by S. Montrul), which proposes:

--
  + Language development is interrupted due to a reduction in input

--
  + HSs differ as a group from other groups of speakers as a result


--
- Putnam and Sánchez discuss *feature reassembly:*

--
  + In generative linguistics, language is made up of bunches of features

--
  + These features get *reassembled* if exposure to the HL is low (prediction of language loss)

--
  + Producing the HL is harder than interpreting it (explains scenario of balanced bilinguals)

--
  + Language acquisition as a process; explains differences between/within speakers
  

--
- These theories do NOT make conflicting predictions, BUT…

--
  + …Putnam &amp; Sánchez (2013) is proposed as an alternative to incomplete acquisition

--
  + …They do differ on philosophical grounds (should we study group-level differences at all?)


---
# Shifting Our Methods


--
- The way we craft our studies can be limiting in the contributions we make!


--
- To test individual differences, we need detailed and precise questionnaire data to gather information about:

--
  + Patterns of exposure and use

--
  + Age of acquisition


--
- In order to evaluate within-speaker differences, we need to:

--
  + Study both production and receptive knowledge (separate tasks)

--
  + Conduct longitudinal studies, whenever possible
  
--
  + Test multiple linguistic structures or areas


--
- We almost always design studies whose questions focus on only 1-2 of three levels mentioned previously:


--
  + Group-level

--
  + Individual-level

--
  + Within-speaker


---
# Results


- Spanish-dominant bilingual adults produce and select subjunctive more than all *groups* of heritage speakers


--
- Individual differences paint a different picture:

--
  + 25/109 HSs produced subjunctive within the range of Spanish-dominant adults

--
  + All participants used (produced + selected) subjunctive in at least 2 instances

--
  + HSs are either gradient or categorical in using the subjunctive (but never in omitting it), so group-level differences are quite misleading


--
- Proficiency and use of Spanish modulated individual subjunctive production and selection rates


--
- Older children and adults use similar rates of subjunctive, more than the fifth grade children


--
- Greater selection of subjunctive than production (in line with Putnam and Sánchez, 2013)


--
- Sets the stage for creating a comprehensive theory of HL acquisition by children:


--
  + Nuances at the between-groups, individual, and within-speaker levels

--
  + (Indirectly) evaluates continued development across the childhood years

--
  + Along with partner studies, requires bridging theoretical linguistics with the education

--
  + Achieves a new perspective that HSs' grammars are *more* complex than those of monolinguals


---
# Pausing, Reflecting, and Transitioning


--
- Any questions, theoretical or otherwise?


--
- What are the implications of this work for our view of heritage bilingualism?


--
- How can we make these data transparent and reproducible to contribute to open science?


--
- How do we make critical decisions in R that influence our analyses?


---
# Reproducible Research in R Using GitHub


--
- Anonymized data without identifiers (name, DOB, any sort of ID number, etc.) are not human subjects data and can be shared publicly


--
- The data and code from this study (and all studies from my dissertation) are available on GitHub, and links to the repository are in my manuscripts (https://github.com/pthane/DLI-Morphosyntax-2023)


--
- GitHub is a place to store codes and other documents related to your research such as:


--
  + *ANONYMIZED* CSV files

--
  + Scripts used for coding
  
--
  + Text files explaining the structure of your repository (usually RTF files)

--
  + Presentations and HTML documents prepared in RMarkdown


--
- This allows others to download and elaborate on your work for free


--
  + GitHub membership is free and unlimited with an @.edu email address
  
--
  + Public repositories are visible to the entire Internet
  
--
  + R is free, and RTF files do not require Microsoft Word (accessible to all)


--
- This satisfies open materials requirements for publications along with a list of stimuli or interview questions


---
# Reproducible Coding in R


--
- Using the `here` function helps others who download your work to reproduce it

--
  + Use this when loading or creating CSV or Excel files

--
  + This creates a _relative path_ so that anyone who downloads your code can use it

--


``` r
## Install `here` package
install.packages("here", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org/")
```

```
## 
## The downloaded binary packages are in
## 	/var/folders/fs/8c0p4wh91tq5md1wwk7txz200000gn/T//Rtmpf6Qq5Y/downloaded_packages
```

``` r
## Load `here` package on every script
library(here)


## Load a CSV file with `here`
## (Notice the use of parentheses. The name of the file begins in the same place where the .Rproj file is stored. We will use the adult HSs' production data as an example.)
My_Data &lt;- read_csv(here("CSV Files", "Adult HS", "Adult HS Subjunctive EPT.csv"))
```

# Presentations in R with `xaringan`


- The `xaringan` package allows you to turn an RMarkdown file into slides that contain code

--
  + This and all presentations in my GitHub repository were created using `xaringan`

--
  + `xaringan` allows you to use any code as you would in regular R scripts to create presentations


--
- Using `xaringan` has a number of advantages:

--
  + Great for conference presentations that you want others to be able to see after via GitHub

--
  + Great for projects with ongoing data collection

--
  + Perfect for showing a reproducible product to general audiences

--
  + You can post code in your slides, allowing others to learn


--
- Tutorial for using `xaringan`: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPFh3y9UAX4

--
  + Includes 2 hours of instruction and practice activities

--
  + You don't need all 2 hours to get started and get familiar


---
# Sharing `xaringan` RSlides Using GitHub


- All data can be downloaded and presentations can be shared using stable URLs


--
- You must create a subfolder in your RProject with an RMarkdown file named index.Rmd in it, where you will put all of your code to create your slides


--
- After you knit your RMarkdown file with all of the desired code for the presentation, you can upload it to GitHub.


--
- Every GitHub repository has settings to make it into a GitHub site:

--
  + Settings &gt; Pages (on left menu)

--
  + In _Pages_, select 'main' under 'Branches' (this is only possible after you have uploaded files)
  
--
  + Remember to save your settings!


--
- Review of how to create HTML page: https://mbounthavong.com/blog/2022/7/30/hosting-a-r-markdown-html-file-on-a-github-page


--
- When uploaded to a GitHub repository, the resulting index.html file will automatically turn into a public version of your slides after a few minutes!

---
# Tying It All Together


- The BLC paper was prepared using *fully* open science:


--
  + Published open access in BLC (free for you while at OSU: https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/open-access-policies/read-and-publish-agreements/oa-agreement-ohiolink)
  
--
  + All anonymized data are on GitHub and visible to anyone

--
  + `here` and `xaringan` make it easy to share these results with others


--
- Theoretical contributions to language acquisition theory *should* be reproducible because:

--
  + Language is a human right (and bilingualism therefore is too)

--
  + Our ability to make claims about the way that language works depends on the analyses we perform
  
--
  + Sometimes, others may have different ideas on how to make analyses more robust, and sharing our approach is a necessary first step


---
# Closing Questions


- Please always feel free to reach out! pdthane@central.uh.edu

- Time for additional questions about anything you might find useful to know:


--
  + More questions about the broader scope of the article

--
  + How coding decisions impact our analyses and perceptions

--
  + The job market in bilingualism
